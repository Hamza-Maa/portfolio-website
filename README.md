## üñ•Ô∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

- Node.js: [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- npm: npm is distributed with Node.js, so it should be installed together.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Hamza-Maa/portfolio-website.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd portfolio-website
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running Locally

To run the portfolio website locally:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The site will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Build for Production

To generate a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create an optimized build of the project in the `dist/` folder.

### Deployment

I‚Äôve deployed this site using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), but you can also use services like GitHub Pages, Vercel, or Firebase Hosting. For deploying on Netlify:

1. Install the Netlify CLI if you haven‚Äôt already:
   ```bash
   npm install netlify-cli -g
   ```

2. Run the following command to build and deploy:
   ```bash
   netlify deploy --prod
   ```
